# Deploying to Vercel

Since you bought the domain on Vercel, deployment is seamless.

1.  **Push your code** to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
2.  **Go to Vercel Dashboard** (vercel.com).
3.  Click **"Add New..."** -> **"Project"**.
4.  **Import** the `ElectromecWeb` repository you just pushed.
5.  **Deploy**. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js.
6.  Once deployed, go to **Settings > Domains** in your new project.
7.  Add `electromeccc.com`. Since you bought it on Vercel, it might already be configured or just needs a simple "Add" click.

## Verification
- Visit `https://electromeccc.com` to see your live "2026" site.
- Check the "System Status: Online" indicator in the Hero section.
