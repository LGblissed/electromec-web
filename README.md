Source code for the ElectroMec digital presence. This project serves as the central hub for the family electrical materials business in Carlos Casares.

⚡ Workflow & Philosophy
This project is built using a Local-First, AI-Augmented workflow. It rejects the standard "copy-paste" coding paradigm in favor of an agentic approach.

Environment: Developed locally using Google Antigravity (Agentic IDE).

Methodology: "Mutual Play." The AI Agent acts as the architect and builder, while the human developer acts as the Director and Quality Assurance lead.

State Management: All logic and credential management live strictly in the local environment (.env) before static generation. No logic relies on public cloud functions for core rendering.

Optimization: Code is optimized for low latency ("0ms lag" target) and semantic cleanliness to ensure accessibility and performance on all hardware.

🛠 Tech Stack
Core: Python (Backend/Generation), HTML/CSS/JS (Frontend).

Deployment: Static delivery (FTP/Edge).

CI/CD: Manual "Human-in-the-loop" verification. No automated pushes without review.
